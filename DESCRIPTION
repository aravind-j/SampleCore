Description: Implements several sampling strategies for construction of core 
    collections. These include 1) Stratified sampling based on group size 2) 
    Stratified sampling based on group diversity 3) Sampling based on genetic 
    distance between accessions. See the vignette for more, including full list 
    of citations for the methods implemented.
